## Objectives

- Build a logistic regression model, structured as a shallow neural network.
- Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent.
- Implement computationally efficient, highly vectorized, versions of models.
- Understand how to compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
- Become familiar with Python and Numpy.
- Work with iPython Notebooks.
- Be able to implement vectorization across multiple training examples.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Code

The code is provided in the `Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
