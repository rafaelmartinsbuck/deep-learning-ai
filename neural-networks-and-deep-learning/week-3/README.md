## Objectives

- Understand hidden units and hidden layers
- Be able to apply a variety of activation functions in a neural network.
- Build your first forward and backward propagation with a hidden layer
- Apply random initialization to your neural network
- Become fluent with Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations
- Build and train a neural network with one hidden layer.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Code

The code is provided in the `Planar_data_classification_with_one_hidden_layer.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Planar_data_classification_with_one_hidden_layer.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Planar_data_classification_with_one_hidden_layer.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
