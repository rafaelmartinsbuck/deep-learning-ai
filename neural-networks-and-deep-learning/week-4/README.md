## Objectives

- See deep neural networks as successive blocks put one after each other
- Build and train a deep L-layer Neural Network
- Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations.
- Understand how to use a cache to pass information from forward propagation to back propagation.
- Understand the role of hyperparameters in deep learning

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Code

The code is provided in the `Deep_Neural_Network_Application.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Deep_Neural_Network_Application.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Deep_Neural_Network_Application.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
